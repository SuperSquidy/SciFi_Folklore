New weapon types: Wrench, Pistol
Plasmids: Electro Bolt
Tonics: none
The game begins with a plane crash scene. When you are floating in the ocean, head towards the lighthouse and get inside. Get on the bathysphere and pull the lever in there. You'll be on your way to Rapture.
After the Splicer gets away, pick up the radio. You'll come to know Atlas - you'll be getting objectives from him for quite a long time now.

01 - Here is where we really start our adventure. To make the best use of our guide, try to look on our maps as often as necessary. Also, try to walk around the levels in the order we suggest with our green numbers.
Get to higher ground - this is your first objective n the game.
02 - A Vita-Chamber to be found here. Vita-Chambers are sort of respawn locations for our protagonist. Each time you're defeated, you'll be reborn in the nearest Vita-Chamber, no consequences whatsoever.
03 - Pick up the wrench. It will serve you as a weapon of choice during most parts of the game. Why? Simple: ammo doesn't come in numbers in BioShock, and the wrench doesn't require any. Use the wrench to smash the rubble and crouch to get further.

HINT: Remember to search everything and everyone in the game. Each body and each container can contain some useful items, such as ammo, health packs or EVE hypos. Your inventory is unlimited in space so don't hesitate to collect lots of junk. Some of it might come in handy once you start using U-Invent stations later in the game.

04 - You'll meet your first adversary here. It's a Thuggish Splicer. Defeat him using the Wrench and go up the stairs. Search through trash cans in there for some hypos, then pick up your first plasmid - Electro Bolt. After a short scene use your newly acquired power to open the door (hit the controls to the left). Grab some snacks from the table before you go.
HINT: Possibly the best combo in the game is to hit an opponent with an electro bolt and then smash him with the wrench.
HINT: Use right mouse button to switch between weapon and plasmid attacks.

Go through the passage and run along the corridor, through the destroyed plane fragment. Once you're on the other side, defeat another Splicer. There are some health packs and EVE hypos in here. Go through the door, defeat a Splicer and go further. Enter the elevator and go up.
05 - Atlas asks you to help him rescue his family. Well, you don't have anything better to do, do you?
06 - Kill the Splicer and take a pistol from the pram.

HINT: There are a few types of ammo for each weapon. Press [Shift] to check out which ammo types you can equip.
07 - Go down the stairs to the bottom floor. You'll meet a Lead Splicer in here. The difference between them and the Thugs is that they can use firearms. Don't use pistol for now, these enemies can be easily dealt with using the wrench. Also, try out shooting an Electro Bolt into enemies who are standing in water (there's an Achievement for that).

You'll find your first Audio Diary here. These are the recordings that contain the essence of the game's story. Try not to miss them. AUDIO DIARY: [New Year's Eve Alone] - Diane McClintock.

Head back up and go towards the toilets. Enter the right toilet first.
08 - AUDIO DIARY: [Hole in the Bathroom Wall] - Steve Barker.
09- Here you'll see a Big Daddy showing off for the first time. Remember: Big Daddies are always neutral towards you, unless you attack them first.

Destroy the padlock and go further. When you see three Splicers in water, shoot them with an Electro Bolt.
When you approach the passage to Neptune's Bounty, a security alarm will sound. Defeat all the Splicers (again, notice that they're jumping into water!) and go towards the Medical.
10 - After a short speech from Andrew Ryan go through the hatch.

Tonics: Hacker's Delight, Security Expert, Speedy Hacker, Wrench Jockey, Static Discharge, Armored Shell(for sale), EVE Link(for sale)
01 - Leave the hatch and head towards the foyer. Hack the security bot that blocks the door to the South. When you succeed, this bot will fight by your side until it's destroyed.
HINT: A detailed description of hacking can be found in an appropriate section of the guide.
02 - There's an Audio Diary in here.
AUDIO DIARY: [Adam's Changes] - Steinman
Go up the stairs and use the lever. A few Splicers will appear. A door opened behind your back so turn around and go through it. There's a Machine Gun at the other end.

03 - Use another switch and a few new enemies appear. Defeat them and collect another Audio Diary.
AUDIO DIARY: [Released Today] - Diane McClintock
Go through the door into Medical Pavillon. You'll have another vision along the way - you'll see some girl's ghost. Use the switch to open the door at the end.

04 - There are two turrets here (check out the map), as well as 5 audio diaries. To make things easier, strike both turrets with the electro bolt and try to hack them [press V to hack]. This way they will help you eliminate your opponents around here.
AUDIO DIARY: [Higher Standards] - Steinman
AUDIO DIARY: [Parasite Expectations] - Andrew Ryan
AUDIO DIARY: [Vandalism] - Andrew Ryan (it is next to the machines to the north)
AUDIO DIARY: [Love for Science] - Tenenbaum
AUDIO DIARY: [Limits for Imagination]- Steinman
Go South, through the door that says Eternal Flame.

05 - Take an audio diary (it's below the portrait) and go further due South. You'll meet a new type of enemy here - a Nitro Splicer. These folks mostly use grenades to bomb you from a distance.
AUDIO DIARY: [Surgery's Picasso] - Steinman

Medical Pavillion Pt 2

When you see the furnace, press the button nearby to burn the body and you'll get your first tonic: Hacker's Delight. For more information on tonics check out the appropriate section of the guide. For now, go up the stairs.
06 - Crouch and go through the opening in the wall into the office of sorts. Here you find your second plasmid - Incinerate! Take it and use it on a nearby oil patch to dispose of all the enemies around.

07 - You can now use your Incinerate power to melt the ice that blocks entrance to Twilight Fields. In the western part you'll see a door that's code protected. The code is 0451. There's some ammo inside. Go further south and swim across the canal. Here's another tonic: Security Expert. When you head back, you'll be attacked by a Thug.
08 - Go back to the main hall and go back the stairs to the dental section. Use Incinerate to melt the ice again. There's an audio diary.
AUDIO DIARY: [Freezing Pipes] - McDonagh
09 - You'll see a shotgun in the middle of a room. Take it and the lights will go out for a moment. You now have to hold back a few Splicers that come at you. Near the entrance to Dandy Dentals you'll see another audio diary.

AUDIO DIARY: [Useless Experiments] - Tenenbaum
10 - In Dandy Dental you'll see a room with a "tennis" look to it. Enter and grab another plasmid - Telekinesis.
HINT: You now only have 2 plasmid slots so you have to get rid of one of the plasmids for some time. We strongly suggest you stick to Electro Bolt and Telekinesis. By the way,Telekinesis is used by clicking the mouse button and holding it to grab objects, then releasing to throw them. You can use this power in combat (throw explosive barrels), to destroy rocket turrets, or to solve some minor puzzles.
AUDIO DIARY: [Testing Telekinesis] - Suchong

11 - Enter Kure-All. There's a rocket turret here - it's a good opportunity to get acquainted with your Telekinesis ability. Grab its projectiles and throw them back at it. Go further to look around the clinic.
AUDIO DIARY: [Enrage trial] - Suchong
12 - Near the audio diary you'll see a small air vent. Smash it and get inside. You'll find a secret room containing a great tonic to have: Wrench Jockey.
13 - To get to Painless Dental you have to smash the window and jump through it (crouching). It's good to get rid of the turret first (you can use Electro Bolt to stun it, but remember it will last but a couple of seconds). Inside you'll see an audio diary and a tonic: Speedy Hacker.
AUDIO DIARY: [Plasmids are the paint] - Suchong.
14 - To get inside Chompers, you have to use Telekinesis to grab the key that you can see through the window. When you have it, use it to open the door. There's some ammo and a safe in there.
15 - When you head back up, use the Electro Bolt on the door mechanism near the last room you haven't visited yet.
16 - Go westwards through the corridor.

17 - Some Nitro Splicer will block your way from here. When he starts throwing grenades at you from the balcony, grab one of them with Telekinesis and throw it into the rubble that blocks the way. Go through. You'll find another tonic along the way - Static Discharge.
AUDIO DIARY: [Symmetry] - Steinman
18 - There's a safe and an audio diary in here.
AUDIO DIARY: [Aphrodite Walking] - Steinman
19 - Here is where you finally face doctor Steinman. He's quite resistant to blows and can cause you a little problem. The best way to kill him is to stun him with an Electro Bolt and then shoot him with a Shotgun (short range). Try to take cover whenever you are under heavy fire. When you see him running into the watery section of the arena, use an Electro Bolt to electrify the water.
When you defeat him, grab the key from him body. Also, search the body that's laying on his table for another audio diary.
AUDIO DIARY: [Not what she wanted] - Steinman
20 - When you head back to the main section, Ryan will blow up one of the corridors. Take left and you'll see a scene with a Little Sister. You now have to decide whether you want to harvest her (160 ADAM) or rescue her (80 ADAM). This choice, well, matters. If you want some advice on what to choose, please read the "Little Sisters and Big Daddies" section of our guide. Beware of the spoilers, though.

Use the nearby Gatherer's Garden vending machine to spend your ADAM. At this level we think it's best to buy some upgrades to health and EVE - Enrage plasmid that can be found here didn't really impress us in terms of deadliness. Notice the audio diary near the machine.
AUDIO DIARY: [Gatherer's Vulnerability] - Steinman
21 - Once you go back to the central part of the level, you'll see another Little Sister. This one is protected by a Big Daddy. You shouldn't skip the Big Daddy fights in the game, you know. This might seem a little tough at first, but saving/killing the Little Sisters is essential to the game. Your weapons are quite weak now, but remember that you have infinite number of "lives" in the game, and Big Daddy's health doesn't regenerate. You do the math. Well, for now it'd be best for you to use Electric Bucks to deal with him.
When you kill Big Daddy and get the ADAM, you'll be done with this level. Head towards the emergency exit and use the lever once more. The alarm will be turned off and your passage to Neptune's Bounty will be finally open.

01 - Go along the corridor up to the big room.
02 - There's a Little Sister here, altogether with her Big Daddy. This one's a little bit different from the one you've fought before. He's mostly using firearms (this type of Big Daddy is called Rosie). There's an audio diary in here as well, it's at the southern end of this room (you have to crouch and get near the turret there). Also, notice a tonic around the center of the room: Medical Expert.
AUDIO DIARY: [Bathysphere Keys] - Sullivan
03 - In this Gatherer's Garden you can buy some new plasmids and tonics (Winter Blast, Target Dummy, Extra Nutrition). May we suggest buying an extra plasmid slot?
HINT: When you rescue 3 girls, Tenenbaum will send you a gift that can be collected right here. It will contain 200 ADAM and a Hypnotize Big Daddy plasmid.

04 - Jump over the crates and "knock" on the door. Peach Wilkins will talk to you. He won't let you in unless you bring him 3 photos of Spider Splicers. One of these unpleasant types will attack you in a few seconds. Try to hold her off for a while and Atlas will help you by sending in a security bot. The damage you deal is too low for you to hurt her, but luckily enough she will run off after a while. Peach will send you a Grenade Launcher through the conveyor belt.


05 - Go down the stairs and go through the watery corridor until you see a code lock. The code is 5380 (you can also hack it if you like). There's an audio diary here.
AUDIO DIARY: [Timmy H. Interrogation] - Sullivan
06 - In this corridor you will see another Audio Diary. In order to get it, you have to enter the hole in the floor and go under it.

AUDIO DIARY: [Watch Fontaine] - Andrew Ryan (it's by the Circus of Value)

08 - Go through the vent near the turrets to grab yet another audio diary and some munitions.
AUDIO DIARY: [Have my badge] - Sullivan
When you smash through the turrets, go through a hole in the wall and head along the corridor until you find a research camera. Take it and take a photo of a nearby Spider Splicer
HINT: You can find more info on using your camera (conducting research) in an appropriate section of the guide. Notice that it's best to start researching right from the start - meaning: now.

Neptune’s Bounty pt 2
09 - After an explosion jump down through the window (notice the Security Bullseyeplasmid here!). Grab two audio diaries as you progress.
AUDIO DIARY: [Adam Discovery] - Tenenbaum
AUDIO DIARY: [Eden Leaking] - McDonagh

10 - There's an Audio Diary at the junction.
AUDIO DIARY: [Fontaine's Smugglers] - Tenenbaum
11 - In Jet Postal you can see another Spider Spicer. Kill it and take its photo. Notice that when a Spider Splicer grabs the ceiling and starts walking around it, you can use Electro Bolt to bring it down. If you run out of "ammo" for the camera, you can buy some more film in most Circuses of Value. Grab an audio diary before you leave.
AUDIO DIARY: [Death Penalty in Rapture] - Andrew Ryan
12 - To find the audio diary hidden here, you must go into the water near the vital chamber and enter the vent. Once you're there, head to the other side of the tunnel.
AUDIO DIARY: [Meeting Ryan] - McDonagh
13 - There's another Audio Diary here, as well as a safe with some minor items. You can get into the hidden room by smashing the crates that block the entrance.
AUDIO DIARY: [Rapture changing] - McDonagh
14 - When going back from point [13], use Electro Bolt on the door mechanism to get here.
AUDIO DIARY: [Smuggling Ring] - Sullivan (table at the middle)
AUDIO DIARY: [Working late again] - Andrew Ryan (table by the window)

15 - In the toilet you can find a few proximity mines. To enter, you have to put in 5$.
16 - Go up the stairs. There's the last Spider Splicer you have to photograph in here. Before you head back to Peach's, look around the area here. In room nr 6 there's an audio diary (use Electro Bolt on the door). The code to room nr 7 is 7533. There's also an audio diary in there, as well as a tonic: Shorten Alarms. Before you leave the tavern, you might come across a Little Sister for some ADAM.
AUDIO DIARY: [Arresting Fontaine] - McDonagh
AUDIO DIARY: [Saw Masha today] - Mariska Lutz
17 - A new tonic appeared by the Gatherer's Garden: Wrench Lurker. Buy some upgrades if you have the currency and head to Fontaine's Fisheries. Knock on the door again. This time he will open it for you.

18 - There's a tonic frozen in the ice here: Focused Hacker. Use Incinerate to get to it. If you don't have this plasmid in any of your slots, use the nearby gene bank to enable it. You now have to place all your firearms into the pneumotube.
19 - Not surprisingly, you have to fight Peach in here. The difficulty about this fight is that you don't have any regular weapons: only your plasmids. Notice some security cameras around the area. You can hack them for some serious support. This way Peach will be under heavy fire at all times. You, meanwhile, can try to throw explosive barrels at him using Telekinesis. It's the best thing to do here as he's quite resistant to Electro Bolt and Incinerate. Of course, you can always try to chase him with a wrench. It isn't as stupid as it sounds.

After you beat him, take your weapons from another pneumotube. Take a look around - you can melt any pile of ice here for some additional items.
20 - In here you will see your fist weapon upgrade station. These ones are called Power to the People. Each of them gives you one free upgrade of choice, then shuts down irreversibly. Choose wisely, then. Before you leave, melt the ice to enter the storage to the right for another audio diary.
AUDIO DIARY: [Putting the screws on] - Peach Wilkins
21 - Once you're ready, head for the exit.

AUDIO DIARY: [The Saturnine] - Langford
21 - You might see another Little Sister in the gardens here. When you get her ADAM, head west, towards Langford's offices. She will speak to you through the radio and order you to get a rosa galica for her. It can be found in the waterfall grotto (point [14]). When you're on your way there, you'll see three Splicers desecrating a body - defeat them and grab the Security Evasion tonic. Go to the grotto and grab the rose. Head back to the lab and use the pneumo tube to send it to Langford. She will open the door for you.
22 - Look around to find a Hacking Expert tonic, as well as two diaries.
AUDIO DIARY: [What Won't They Steal] - Langford

07 - You can buy a new plasmid here: Insect Swarm.
AUDIO DIARY: [Adam Explained] - Tenenbaum

08 - You have to find 7 samples of the bee enzyme in the Apiary here. There's even more than 7 in here, so don't be afraid you miss something. 3 samples are in a safe to the left. Use the lever here to release the smoke. It will keep the bees away for some time - quickly go down and start searching through the hives. Some splicers will appear and make it even tougher for you. When you hear that the smoke is nearly off, retreat and turn it on again. Leave once you have all the necessary samples.
09 - When you're inside the winery, get rid of the turrets and the cameras, then search for an audio diary. Go down the stairs to the cellar.
AUDIO DIARY: [Functional Children] - Tenenbaum
10 - In this cellar you must find 7 bottles of distilled water. It's simple, just keep your eyes open and they will eventually fall into your hands. You'll see an opening in one of the western walls. Jump down to grab a lot of ammo and a tonic: Photographer's Eye. The lowest level is quite a big area, but the only thing worth searching for in there is the Power to the People station. When you have all the bottles you need, head back to Arcadia [01].

Arcadia Once More
Before you can invent the Lazarus Factor, you'll need 7 bottles of chlorophyll. There's a chance that you already have enough (check your in-game objectives). If you don't just walk around and kill some Houdini Splicers. Each of them has a bottle of it.

Go back to Langford's lab and use the U-Invent station to create the Lazarus Factor. Go to late scientist's office and use the Central Misting Control. As suggested by Atlas, run to the lab's entrance and close it by hitting the switch. You now have to hold off a number of Ryan's thugs. The best way to win here is to use Hypnotize Big Daddy plasmid on the giant that's neutrally walking around the lab. With his help there should be no problem.
When Atlas says that it's time to release the factor, run back to the office and use another lever. The forest will be brought back to life. When you feel ready, head to the Bathysphere station. There's one last audio diary on this level there.

When you're going back to the bar, you'll see Rodriguez in there. He'll start running as soon as he sees you, so chase him with your crossbow equipped, waiting for a good moment to take him down. As always, take a snapshot of his body and take it back to Sander's piece of art. Before you go back, though, check out Eve's Garden again - there will be another audio diary.
AUDIO DIARY: [It's All a Grift] - Rodriguez
When you're back to Cohen's domain, he will finally appear in person before you. You can now either kill him and take his muse (a chest containing a few pretty worthless items), or keep him alive to deal with him later (it's a lot better, trust us on this). Your reward for helping Cohen will be Medical Expert 2.
HINT: Before you leave this level, once again go up the stairs [C]. This time you can enter the projector room to grab an audio diary and a tonic: Electric Flesh.

AUDIO DIARY: [Assembling the Bomb] - Kyburz
You need the following ingredients:
1x Nitroglycerine Charge: Head back to Kyburz's office and press a button on his desk. You can now grab the charge from the wall.
4x R-34 Wire Cluster: You have to search through 4 Big Daddies' bodies to find these. One of them lays dead in the workshops, so it's an easy shot, but the other three will require you to actually kill the monsters once more (well, if you're lucky, there's a chance that the bodies of the ones you've already killed haven't disappeared already).
2x Ionic Gel: If you looked closely around this area, you must have noticed strange blue canisters that you couldn't pick up. These are the ones you want now. Two of them, to be precise. You can find them around the core area.
When you have all the ingredients, head back to Kyburz's secret room and place them all inside the bomb, then take the thing with you.


12 - Go to Geothermal Control and reach the end of the room. It'd be wise to hack the two turrets instead of destroying them, they will come in handy in just a few seconds. Start turning the valve. Some Splicers will burst into the room. Fight them or rely on your turrets - one way or another, you must turn the valve to make the lava flow. Once it's done, turn around and take the elevator down.
Go along the corridor. There's a tonic in here: Shorten Alarms 2. Reach the end and go up, using another elevator. Place the bomb on the core. When all hell breaks loose, run back to Ryan's Office. Hit the circuit breaker near the armored gate to make it open at last.

Proving Grounds
Well, it's not a fully-scaled level as those you've seen so far. Basically, the idea is: you are the Big Daddy and you have to protect your Little Sister. She is to collect ADAM from three bodies (marked by stars on our map above). It's not an easy task, really. Splicers will come at you most of the time, and to make things worse the Little Sister triggers all the security systems (they don't react to your presence, for a change). If your girl is defeated, you have to go back to the nearest vent and hit it with a wrench to summon another one. Don't be afraid, though: the outcome of this level doesn't influence the game's ending. If you saved the girls, you can still get the good ending - even if you let some of them die here.

A few hints to keep you going:
- Hack all the security systems instead of destroying them!
- Use your surroundings. There's a lot of spilled oil here and there.
- A good plasmid to use here is Winter Blast. You might suppose why.
- Your weapons don't deal damage to the Little Sister, so don't hesitate to throw grenades all over her if she's surrounded by enemies.
Near the end of the level a Bouncer will blast through the wall and attack you. When you bring it down, you'll be done with assisting the girl. Take the Hypo that's given to you by one of the Little Sisters. Look around the vending machines here. Now is the time to do your shopping one last time. When you're ready, enter the elevator to meet your destiny (or whatever).



Le Grande Finale
Fontaine got a little spliced up since you've seen him just a while ago in Point Prometheus. Well, would you kindly kill the bastard? Run up to him and use the ADAM Collecting Hypo on him to drain some of his power. He'll hit you back and begin the battle.
The battle consists of three separate phases. Fontaine has three forms: fiery, icy and electric. Despite all your possible thoughts on how to beat elemental-based bosses in video games, you don't have to use anything specific against him. Just hit him hard. Grenades can make your day in this duel, as well as explosive ammo for the shotgun. Don't fight the Splicers he summons from time to time - they are pretty harmless compared to the big man himself anyway. In order to survive here, you have to keep moving! Strafe, strafe, strafe like there's no tomorrow, I tells ya. Fontaine attacks you by long-range energy missiles and by melee thrusts (he kinda sums up the Bouncers with the Rosies). His attacks are not very difficult to dodge, as long as you keep MOVING!! If you don't, you'll die anyway - make that a lesson. Always keep in mind your health and use the 9 health packs you have (you do, right?) wisely.

After each phase you have to approach Fontaine when he's trapped in his machine and use the hypo on him. If you don't make it fast enough, you will have to repeat a given phase - and that sucks, believe me. After you defeat him in all three forms, a heartwarming (or not) ending will commence.
So, you're done with BioShock. Did you like it?
