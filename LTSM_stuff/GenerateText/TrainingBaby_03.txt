there's a couple of things to do here, and your main goal is to get to the upper floor Approach Zoltun Kulle's body with caution, because it will be heavily defended So read this walkthrough knowing some level of spoilers may be present He talks about  the crime that he was (falsely) accused of committing, when  he escaped from the interrogation room and took Lynne  hostage Once you get the intended result, go over and speak with Victoria   Now move all of them to the left There is no acheivement for this, but if you make it to the side room wihtout raising the water from 2nd level to 3rd level, you can see the whale swimming in a circle on the ceiling and even go up there and play on its back If you kill the clicker you will find supplies in the bathroom that is off to the left You will arrive at an extremely heavy door, one which Chris struggles to open  There will most likely be a Gel in your path to get to the Dungeon Map, so kill it if necessary and grab the Map Approach the previously blocked doors and take the pneumatic lock off them, by pulling on the lever   Re-enter the lab on this side and as soon as you enter, look to the right to find a trail We ran into a dead end and decided to Hide instead ofTurn Back  Find Zoltun Kulle's head The portal will transport you to an entirely new area and your objective is to find Zoltun Kulle's head It's almost certain that the enemy will enter the room as well, so just wait for it to go away, leave the room and take a turn to the right  The Guardian of the Park appears around this time  Go forward through the door then through another door to get some supplies Leave this room and jump in the tube this time to reach a higher area Leave her room and go outside Initiate it to talk to Ellie about the Fireflies He is almost  instantly caught by the Masked Muscleman Just approach the wall before the chamber and freeze the purple Squeept that jumps up and down in front of it In the forest right after the speed section at the start, just before you  enter the research facility, the trail is on the left, in the grass   and wait with Jo in the small gap From this room you can either bomb the north wall for a shortcut, or travel left and up Wait until the catapult is ready before moving on The function and JAUNT, Equip yourself the corresponding key to escape when Royce makes his combos   Go left and climb up the beams He notices the  binoculars, picks them up, and takes them with him when he  answers the phone call Place the first portal high on the wall to the right of the raised area  Move forward and open a gated door to trigger a trap  Then, go to the newspaper clipping, to the light and to the  blackboard Do not worry if you destroy a cube in the emancipation grid, as another one will simply be deployed for you There is another photo here though, so head right towards the garage door   Now move Chris to the right   and go down until you reach the exit So it's generally a better idea to follow the second route Someone used a ghost trick that night  to ensure the machine would kill Jowd's wife  Turn around, climb up the stairs and activate the panel to close the ARK chamber We ultimately rationalized that due to his crush on Ashley, Chris would choose to save her rather than Josh, which is too bad, since Josh was a likeable character as well WATERFALL: PART 2  Tips for Waterfall: Part 2: ?
