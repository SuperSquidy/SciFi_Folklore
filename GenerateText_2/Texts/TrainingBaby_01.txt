have John and Claire Kill all three of them for a key to appear Head up from here, as that's all you can do In short: avoid it completely  This room has a new enemy, the Vire   Move Sam to the right on the bottom of the large block You do the math Enter the elevator and go up Norfair is also along the path to Ridley's Hideout   Arrange them like this so Jo can jump on Sam   and get to the top   The block will now move and wait until it stops   Move them into the water   And jump with Sarah to activate the button on the left Next, you need to get the cube off the platform, and onto the first button  Avoid the Like-Likes and the Blade Traps and head up Select the spooky forest, and the  book tells a story of how an evil witch came on Shrek, and Fiona's carriage and turned the horses into three blind mice Collect all the diaries along the way —GLaDOS Though difficult, it is possible to get the cube through the exit doorway, thus no longer being able to exit yourself Zola can be defeated with two hits, but it can be quite difficult, so it is better to just avoid them Fall down and place the other portal so you whiz through it Or run very quickly to the other end, jump down, and turn around and fire before they have a chance to pick up speed  The Triforce rests in this room Throughout the test, GLaDOS will make odd remarks about the companion cube, indicating how it is not alive, as if you are very attached to it and insisting that it is going to talk or do things   Build stairs so Jo can get over the 1st green dashed field4 This level contains only Claire and Thomas)  Game Tip- Start Combat with Puss In Boots Jump Attack Feel free to do it Continue left to the next room There are 2 diaries here and a tonic: Security Evasion 2  This room has 3 Goriyas, but they're blue   Invert them and align them to their exit 4x R-34 Wire Cluster: You have to search through 4 Big Daddies' bodies to find these You can't go any further up, so use a key to head right for now Samus can stand on a portion of the "acid" below the section of bridge that can be destroyed The slow method involves freezes his stomach spikes as he launches them at you You have to get past a locked grid-door Gleeok shoots fireballs that cannot be blocked by the Magical Shield, so you must try your best to dodge them When walking farther, you get to the chamber lock, however this is malfunctional, and you have to jump down  Puss In Boots:  He has steely eyes, swashbuckling finesse and really expensive Corinthian footwear   Get her up to the top, the platforms will move completely to the left and right so be sure to use the double jump You should fly onto the raised platform Witches do after all need mice to do witchcraft If you have defeated one or both, then shooting the corresponding statue will cause it to rise   Activate the button  Dungeon Map  This entrance room is the same as any other, so there is not much to say The enrichment center promises to always provide a safe testing environment Use you raft from the dock on this screen to arrive at the fourth dungeon   Get everyone down into the hole     - This dungeon's potion shop is the same as the last dungeon's   Activate the button Once inside, take the center staircase, as that warps you closest to the next destination   For the remaining characters, move them straight through the grey field, they'll get to the other side   Now jump with John on top of Claire Alternatively, a chair from the previous room works   Activate the button using John  In here, there are quite a few Gels The center Patra cannot be hurt until all of the smaller ones around it have been killed In the test area, stand on the button in the middle of the room, and create a portal behind the door that opens Kill Patra and enter the staircase in the center of the room Leave the cave and head right three screens, then up two You don’t need to kill any of them, but do so if you want some extra rupees When you're attacked by a turret, destroy it and jump through the window   Move Laura to her exit   and jump with Chris on top of Laura, he will now bounce high None of them need to be killed, and they don't really pose much of a challenge, so walk around them and grab the compass  This room contains a new enemy, the Goriya, who attacks by throwing a boomerang Place one end of a portal on the energy pellet's scorch mark on the wall, and the other where the receiver is projecting a red spot onto the ceiling Go onto the one that raises the highest, and create a portal on the top of the platform you just entered through If they are coasting, you can safely stand right next to him  Rapture Main Controls LEVEL SUMMARY: # of Audio Diaries: 3 Grab the audio diary near the vita chamber Good luck   You can jump on the other platform or jump straight to the respawn zone then If not, simply place a portal below you They appear and move in whatever direction Samus is in at the time of their appearance    - After leaving The Manji, head back to the start screen Once you get to the surface, you hear an alarm and turrets will shoot you to death as some sudden intense music plays You will also see many gold coins, and snails Head through it So make a portal on the scorch mark where the pellet hits the wall As part of a previously-mentioned required test protocol we can no longer lie to you  You can kill the Stalfos here if you want hearts or rupees, but the northern door in this room is already open, so you can just head up There are 3 diaries here and Power to the People station Spikes will go down at this position so get close to the edge   and jump to the right and back to the left   so you are on top of the moving spike platform   As you progress through the game, you will need to use certain characters' special abilities to continue through the levels Head right eight screens, and up four 09 - Another audio diary Jo has to jump on those smaller blocks to get further This room has three of them along with some Zols and Keese You can bomb the north wall for a secret room entrance, but it's just an Old Man with some information that isn't very useful right now Near one of the samples upstairs you'll find an audio diary Don't allow trick walls, floors and ceilings deter you from investigating further If that was the opposite color of the ground portal, your ground portal was right against the wall, and you look into it, it is possible that you’ll continue your fling all the way to the high platform   5  Along your adventure, you will encounter the following items:  Gold Coins- Use Gold Coins to buy party up-grades or to pay tolls These are the ones you want now When you are done, go around the city, looking for the green Head right using the Magical Key If you don't just walk around and kill some Houdini Splicers After purchasing it, head back through the secret passage and back to the room where you fought the Dodongos  Place a bomb against the left wall and head through it You are not bound to the order presented in this walkthrough; it is simply an example of one way to complete the game   3 After jumping over the large outcropping, you will find the Maru Mari (Round Ball), a modular expansion to Samus' armor that allows her to safely roll up into a small ball As a ball, Samus doesn't have any offensive power This item goes a short distance, but will stun most enemies However, if you fire the portal gun at a wall at the bottom of the pit, then walk into it, you will come back out of the orange portal The explosion will lift you over the gap easily, and you can then collect the tank  Bomb the bottom wall in this room If you pass through the left door, you will enter a long hallway, and you will find the fake Kraid at the very end If you have a bomb you can use it on the upper wall for a shortcut, but we're going around  C) The statues don't lie If you climbed all the way to the top of West Brinstar and followed the long corridor to the left, you may be surprised to find an unusual chamber that contains statues in the forms of the two mini-bosses, Kraid and Ridley, along with an uncrossable chasm over an acid lake   Get Thomas and John on Claire   and move them close to the platform When you drink the antidote, your plasmids will be back to normal     - More enemies known as Zolas appear on this screen   Leap over the spikes to the other side, if you have problems remember that only a few pixels need to be on the ground so you can put the most part of Claire's square over the edge After killing them all, some Bombs will appear and the doors will open Then fall down the deep hole with all of them The Moldorm will remove a section of its body every time you hit it with your sword Since you can't shoot a portal under it, you can instead create one on the red X painted above, and drop another turret or camera on top Blast the red door on the other side with missiles and you will obtain the High Jump boots Naturally this is a lot easier if the fireballs are cooperating    CHAPTER 9 1)  In the 2nd room where you kill the spiders between 2 low platforms5 There is Laura, John and Claire Now just aim yourself to the next platform and then follow a catwalk followed by some doors you just need to open Shoot a portal into the corridor, then go through another portal you set at ground level The mirror explains that this is Gingerbread man's special ability There's a Machine Gun at the other end Cross-pistons You should be in a tall room filled with pistons, and you need to climb it There's a Houdini shrine to the right Have red dispose of them  Here, there is another Teeter-Totter  At the beginning of this level, the fairy tail book will explain that in more  attempts to cheer Shrek up, the company made their way to the fairy  godmother's house Or you may choose to power up as strong as you possibly can before facing either mini-boss  This room contains the first dungeon boss: Aquamentus AUDIO DIARY: [Musical Insult] - Sander Cohen  09 - When the piano blows up, take a photo of Fitzpatrick's body Other players prefer to use the Quick-Quit technique of pausing the game, and pressing up and A on the second controller in order to get to the password screen, then pressing start to continue  There's a blue form of the Darknut in this room Nothing of particular to be found here   Get through the respawn zone, go to the left   and finish the level Use your Candle so you can see, and head up —GLaDOS When you are in the room, go to the two pistons, which raise to two

hungry, and wants pie but who will be willing to "Bring home the blackbird? Fiona, it is your Hero Time!"  Collect a lot of blackbirds, and Fiona's hero time   Do that once more   to get both of them up At this level we think it's best to buy some upgrades to health and EVE - Enrage plasmid that can be found here didn't really impress us in terms of deadliness Destinations A) Back the way you came Once Kraid is finished, you need to return to the elevator that leads back to Brinstar, as there is no where else to go from Hideout I When you look at the cube dispenser, it will drop a cube, and when you look at the panel just above the button, it will angle upwards In fact, you can even use them to create strategic platforms from which you can blast the Zeebetites without interruption This can be accomplished without the High Jump boots, but it’s rather difficult The first way to reach him (which requires the ice beam) is through the lowest red door in the hideout's central column   Swim with Claire to the left   and press the button 5)  After the first large pumpkin on the William Gruff escort 2)  Under the log after you open the gate    - Once you have the first shard of the Triforce, you'll be sent outside of the dungeon Beware of the spoilers, though At this point you can wander around, collect rupees, kill some octoroks, or play the Money Making game  Camera Icon- In the lower right corner the Camera icon shows you the Camera Status Splicers will come at you most of the time, and to make things worse the Little Sister triggers all the security systems (they don't react to your presence, for a change) Also, notice a tonic around the center of the room: Medical Expert Enter it for another thirty rupees 17 - Pharaoh's Fortune Casino Pick it up and head right two rooms Shrek holding on to Fiona's love proved that he loved her  very much, and would not let some pompous king tell him no After falling down, you'll be at the bridge that leads to a red door    - Now that you have all the necessary equipment, you can head for the first dungeon  Smuggler’s Hideout LEVEL SUMMARY: # of Audio Diaries: 3 01 - Go along the corridor   Get to the platform moving up and down on the left,   to the small block on the wall   and on top of the other platform moving up and down   Move Thomas up   until he can't get to the top anymore Dodongo doesn't really have any attacks  Eight Darknuts patrol this room and this room will most likely have some lag Before you head back to the Atrium, take another engineering tonic: Alarm Expert   Now just move all of them to the right, if you use platforms or Claire doesn't matter   Align her to the exit then 14 - Sinclair's Spirits You will each hold up pieces of the Triforce, and the Credits will roll  You may not necessarily find these beans in this order, but this was how and when I found them As a result, it has been split up into two parts so that it can fit inside most browser displays   Associations    3 Points of Interest 1) Here come the Metroids Mother Brain has tailored Tourian to be as close to a paradise for the Metroids that she is breeding as possible It isn't as stupid as it sounds5 There is James and Thomas Beyond it lies another Energy Tank First, create a portal anywhere accessible from your current location, and go through it, bringing you to the ledge3 Move Chris to the right   and activate the button by jumping on it First room Hello again Take care of another Little Sister when you see her Lil' Red can either let her rotten apple's timer run out on its own, or by pressing the Y button again, she can detonate it immediately    - Leave the cave and head to the left one screen, down one screen, and left two on the lower side This time you can enter the projector room to grab an audio diary and a tonic: Electric Flesh When the company gets there,  however, the guard at the front gate will say halt!

Get to one of the higher platforms (either will do, not much momentum is needed), by either walking or creating a portal there, and another one accessible to you Freeze an enemy and use them as a launch pad It's the best thing to do here as he's quite resistant to Electro Bolt and Incinerate7 There is Chris, Laura and John   Once you've done that, enter the exit with James   and Thomas A little bit further you will see a Little Sister    Now is your chance to explore, go around Shrek's swamp, hitting platforms,  and opening gates collecting coins and just basically having a good time with  your Shrek 2 Video Game The same can be done to get you onto the third level, re-using the orange portal in the pit, and placing a new blue portal on the next higher set of panels Another audio diary on the lower level Look right as soon as you enter the building - search the crate for an audio diary   Switch to Grey and jump over the grey dashed fields while he's inverted If you have wave beam, it's probably easier to just attack from the lava For instance, the floor here will kill you He looks and acts very much like the real Kraid, but he can only take three missile hits before he is destroyed To reach the chamberlock – which is on a floor above you – you need to notice that there's a fixed orange portal end in the ceiling above the chamberlock10 Go to the right and leap over to the platforms From here, go right, taking the top of the two paths  Hideout II The battle against Ridley will be a real test for Samus   Colour Grey pink, Sam blue and Jo purple Escape 00 Your escape continues, as you maneuver around tons of pistons and portal your way aroundk Then destroying them with 5 missiles   Move Sarah through the small spike gap From here, head up the stairs and left a screen where you will find another cave8 The water kills Thomas so don't fall into it  Shrek:  Shrek is a big, green, ugly, smelly ogre Even though the door closes you will be able to get to the other side using the other portal   Grab the Heart Container and head up   Jump with Thomas several times to get up the next block   Move Claire to the left   and use Sarah to activate the button  Kill all five Gibdos for yet another key Have Shrek Ogre lift the  small gear, into the area in the beginning of the paragraph Part 2 - Turrets and Energy Pellets If you can manage to look through the glass and not get your view obstructed by turret fire, you’ll notice two laser beams indicating turrets facing away from the entrance, and two turrets facing to your right 02 - You're now in the Tea Garden You'll see Cobb running away To switch between them, press Q or E or the number keys on the keyboard AUDIO DIARY: [First Encounter] - Andrew Ryan AUDIO DIARY: [Hatred] - Tenenbaum  04 - The pump room door is closed with a code lock - the combination is 0512 You can find them around the core area Shoot these blocks when the Waver is in the process of traveling up, and can pass through the hole that you create   Align James to his exit They'll shoot rocks at you, but they're pretty easy to dodge  Remember: Don't get frustrated You can now either kill him and take his muse (a chest containing a few pretty worthless items), or keep him alive to deal with him later (it's a lot better, trust us on this) 11) In the unbroken tombs - break them with Donkey's Burro Blast Don't be afraid, though: the outcome of this level doesn't influence the game's ending Defeat them and take the next audio diary from a room a little bit to the south Tourian is the gray area located in the upper left corner of the map, and cannot be accessed until Kraid and Ridley are defeated We can walk around to get there, however The Old Man here offers you the Magical Sword, the best sword in the game!

be done in any order, but the way described here is probably from easiest to hardest Continue to move to the left until you enter a green chamber composed of bubbles Two turrets are now covering the corridor You'll meet a Lead Splicer in here You can see that this activates a door on the fourth level, and thus a cube will need to be placed on it in order to exit into the chamberlock Either potion will fully restore your health upon use, but the red potion can be used twice Walk to the edge of the pit and look down to see the only reachable floor to put portals on From the room you enter you have direct access to the chamberlock Once it's done, turn around and take the elevator down4 You have James and Thomas, but Thomas doesn't play a big role in this level   Go up the stairs, Jo's

heads and head right Bomb the north wall to continue Enter it for the potion shop8 There is Thomas and Sarah You know where this is going Thomas and John are able to get up without help though Because

Before we head towards the next dungeon, there's a Heart Container we can get   Create a staircase and get Chris up Just walk from one side to the other while avoiding the Keese Now just try to portal out of the gooey – but not lethal – water If you miss this jump, simply go all the way to the bottom of the chamber and walk into the orange portal, as the lack of momentum will put you on the third level    Chamber 19 Chamber 19 is the final test, after which you have been promised cake Before you can enter, you must defeat both Mini-Bosses, then shoot the two statues, which activates a secret bridge5 You play Paul It would be nice to change that, so keep running to the right Notice that when a Spider Splicer grabs the ceiling and starts walking around it, you can use Electro Bolt to bring

Pack Third room As with the first room, you have to perform a double fling; however, you can't start the fling within the same room because of the flooring (technically you can (see ways to reduce portals below 14), but it's extremely difficult) 8)  On a rope to the left after releasing Short Fuse If you get the timing right, you can clear Samus out of the acid, and up to the ledge where you can roll off from and collect the tank Sadly, it is impossible to distinguish this one from the others Once you've done that, head through the opened door The elevator to Hideout II can be found through the door at the bottom of this shaft You will pass a series of Zebo emitting pipes, until you reach a section where the ceiling tiles are slightly different   The block will move to the left,

here, make your way back to the room where you got the dungeon map by going one screen right and two screens down   Now just jump with John out and go to the left   to the exit All that's left to do is continue to the right and through a wall, until you are back into the vertical shaft where you started from There's the last Spider Splicer you have to photograph in here Enter the cave for the Secret Shop   Progress through and use Sarah to get the square on the other side It also gives indications that all of this testing may not be as innocent as it initially seemed to be   Jump up   and continue jumping to the right   until you reach the exit Within the six minutes GLaDOS contaminates the facility, you need to finish her off and dodge the rockets   9 Once you do, you may think the hardest part to reaching the Energy Tank is over, but you'd be wrong If you happen to get forced into the lava in front of Mother Brain, you'll have a difficult time getting out unless you freeze one of the Rinkas and use them as a platform to get back up     Go onto the next area, and go to your right 02 - There's a Little Sister here, altogether with her Big Daddy Do that twice to kill him)  A checkpoint occurs, and the storybook opens Now, before it bounces back through the portal towards the pellet launcher, re-place the blue end of the portal on top of the red area lit by the pellet receiver; thus when the pellet does bounce back into the orange end of the portal, it will come out the blue end heading straight towards the pellet receiver   0 Shoot at the ceiling near the right
