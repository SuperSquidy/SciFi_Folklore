it's out of sight Land on the small spot on the right   and double jump from there to the exit on the top right  This room has some Keese and Bladetraps in the corner Grab the Bow, killing whatever Keese get in your way, then go up the ladder to leave the room Enter the staircase that appears  There's a blue form of the Darknut in this room An intubation associate will be dispatched to revive you with peptic salve and adrenaline Here's another tonic: Security Expert You can only leave if you go right or follow the secret pattern Once they've finished moving (portals can't exist on moving surfaces), place a portal on the panels again, and then fall from either level back into the orange portal end To begin, create a portal at ground level so that you can take a cube up to the platform, using the fixed orange end of the portal there In the northern wall there's a hidden door that can lead you to a safe Use your key on the north door and enter it 17 - There's some ammo around here Notes Getting over the tall column Finding a way to get past the tall pipe at the end of the hallway (to the left of the elevator) can be tricky   Move James to the right   and then jump up to get to the green button The door to the left will take you to a chamber where you can collect the Ice Beam's replacement: the Wave Beam Simply make sure that the right portal connections are made; for example, do not shoot a blue portal in the final room, and then another blue portal next to the moving platform, as you will have gotten rid of the portal in the final room And you will see a horseshoe carved into the gate Simply run back and forth throughout the hallway until you obtain enough energy by defeating Metroids No items can be obtained, so you might as well turn back around   Move John to the right   and align him as close as possible to the ledge Continue and head right a screen   This battle is a lot easier then it may seem at first glance Destinations A) Back the way you came Once Kraid is finished, you need to return to the elevator that leads back to Brinstar, as there is no where else to go from Hideout I   Then get Chris and Thomas over the water,   after that move Thomas close to the edge so Chris can jump on him Or run very quickly to the other end, jump down, and turn around and fire before they have a chance to pick up speed The device has been modified, so that it can now manufacture two linked portals at once At the second tunnel before reaching to Point 4, drop a bomb and go down to a room under Point 4 When all hell breaks loose, run back to Ryan's Office Buy some upgrades if you have the currency and head to Fontaine's Fisheries Active plasmid will be changed randomly once in a while 4)  In the display case when the guards attack in the 2nd room Press the elevator button and ride up There's a pond here that looks sort of like a fairy fountain, but with no fairy When you're done, head south Keep going  on   Now switch to Sam and go back Your weapons are quite weak now, but remember that you have infinite number of "lives" in the game, and Big Daddy's health doesn't regenerate   Slash at the fire and approach Princess Zelda 10 - When you're done with this part of the level, go through the door labeled by a letter D Next, you need to find a place to create your entrance Wow, just wow, Sander Since time is a factor in determining what kind of ending you receive, you may favor an alternate method that reduces the amount of time that Samus spends traversing across the planet 8)  On the 4 vines together near the bees and eggs challenge    CHAPTER 9 1)  In the 2nd room where you kill the spiders between 2 low platforms   Jump with Jo on Sam to get her   into the purple dashed field   Jump with Thomas on John,   then jump on the platform When it is a little less than half way off the ground, freeze it and use it as a platform to jump from and reach the Energy Tank   Put James into the gap so Claire can activate the 2nd blue button Since there is a fixed orange portal end beneath the pellet launcher, it makes sense to put a portal above the pellet receiver, so that when pellets are launched, they go through the portal, and fly into the receiver   Move them into the water   And jump with Sarah to activate the button on the left No cube this time, but on the other hand, you have both halves of the portal gun They jump around the room annoyingly and also are immune to every weapon but your sword and the bow  Shrek Platform- a box that Shrek can pick up, and carry At this point, you may choose to continue to drop down to the bottom of the far right vertical shaft and make your way to Hideout II, and visit points 6 and 7 on your way back to Brinstar   Now move Claire to the left so John can activate it When you're ready, go to Apollo's Square You may be surprised to find a rather small room with a wall to the right Some you may be able to place a portal underneath and save yourself the trouble of getting there yourself   The platform will then start moving, switch to Chris and jump with him onto the platform Shrek holding on to Fiona's love proved that he loved her  very much, and would not let some pompous king tell him no Just slice of his heads and dodge the fireballs as you did the last two times you faced Gleeok Witches do after all need mice to do witchcraft   Finally, get Chris to the exit 8)  In the area immediately after the piranhas and shark appear Blast the door open and run all the way to the right until you reach a new vertical shaft4 You have James and Thomas, but Thomas doesn't play a big role in this level When walking farther, you get to the chamber lock, however this is malfunctional, and you have to jump downis over Exit the cave Place a portal on the extended panels (it doesn't really matter where, but as a general rule, the higher the exit portal is, the further you'll go), and fall into the orange portal end To make it past them, walk into their path and then run back in the doorway (without actually leaving Defeat them and take the next audio diary from a room a little bit to the south If you saved the girls, you can still get the good ending - even if you let some of them die here This will start the platform moving He'll start running as soon as he sees you, so chase him with your crossbow equipped, waiting for a good moment to take him down Grab two audio diaries as you progress7 Move John to the right   into the hole in the ground Two of these are above the mysterious-looking “floor” that will, as GLaDOS points out, kill you, and the third shoots somewhere you cannot see   Jump on the block to the right when it's down Bring them over to where the coupe is at the top of the screen, and hold the X button to aim where you would like to throw them Go through the portal You'll have a long trek to the right to get out of this corridor, and into the vertical shaft that will enable you to climb up and double back around to the original central column of the hideout Walk along the hallway, until you get to a grating  Proving Grounds Well, it's not a fully-scaled level as those you've seen so far As long as you know how to beat him, he'll be extremely easy, otherwise, the Stone Statues will likely kill you Some Splicers will burst into the room Then double-fling yourself back to the other side   Now jump onto the higher located block with spikes on the right 6) Two more Missiles Once you've collected the High Jump boots, you'll be able to hurdle the barrier that stands between you and the two Missile Packs on the other side  Scrapbook: Look at the snapshots for the level Try to kill him with donkey, but watch out don't get  hit by the sword!
