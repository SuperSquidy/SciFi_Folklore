Panda Keychain In the next field, Snapshots pass in version 2 After it ends, ignore the nearby terminal for now (but remember its location) and enter the small room on the opposite side Listen and look out for the enemy to avoid situations such as those -

McDonagh AUDIO DIARY: [Saw Masha today] - Mariska Lutz 17 - A new tonic appeared by the Gatherer's Garden: Wrench Lurker Probably expecting to see a face taken right out of The Ring, Chris and Ashley spin the chair around and discover it to be a dummy dressed in Sam’s clothes On a table to the left you’ll find a Voice Recording clue Optional Photo 1 can now be picked up Heal yourself and go through the next door to continue That's all for this side, so jump back down and climb up the front wall where the door is If you run out of "ammo" for the camera, you can buy some more film in most Circuses of Value Mike asks you to unlock the door around the corner Be prepared for a series of quick time events (QTE’s) to pop on the screen, as a frantic chase scene ensues If you are able to avoid all the names in the credits, which is nearly impossible, you will unlock the Mystery Door in Waterfall! BESTIARY This section will list all the monsters in Undertale and provide the actions needed to Spare them for the True Pacifist ending route  7 At the beginning of the level, after rescuing Tails, you'll have to send a Buddy Bot in the hole to open the force field ahead 10 - Tenenbaum's door is closed here, so you have to try the upper level 03 - Wait for Cohen to finish speaking, then head south to Le Marquis D'Epoque You can bomb the north wall for a secret room entrance, but it's just an Old Man with some information that isn't very useful right now She will ask what you want to eat, and ask you to get the ingredients The pie is not necessary if you are replaying the game for the True Ending You'll be in an area with two moving wheels Head north for the next key Feel free to choose either, but keep in mind that your experience will likely differ from ours if you choose the other option There's a box on the lowest layer of the last bookshelf Locate some Administration Notes on a desk nearby, giving you some insight into these mysterious events Head down Answer the call from Catherine, from the Lambda station, with whom the main character spoke a couple of times  To open the door, you will need the Omnitool (a control panel which requires the tool has a "Swipe Omnitool" sign on it) with the expansion (Tool Chip) you've collected recently All you have to do now is to get to the staircase leading upwards, use the lever to open them, run to the upper floor and close the passageway Now you can use the vents to grab the CROWN above, and climb up the beams to collect another CROWN at the top  The Zeppelin should land in the area by now - go there and place the Omnitool in the socket to activate the tool Head through the area, checking out the various objects you can interact with [15]     - After gathering the needed rupees and upgrades, you can head to Death Mountain Then use the zip line here to get back to the middle path This foe is quite unique, as it does not react to your presence at all - you have to keep eye so that it can locate your position  Awakening The level starts while the character is sitting on the armchair from the previous mission Instead, drop down on a ledge to the right of this area to find a chest and a trail of footprints This version has a shield after conceding a first time Head back to town and find Papyrus outside of his house Indeed, it saves you constantly insofar gauge Planning is full when you receive a normally fatal blow Do that twice to kill him Enter the first doors on the right   Leave your dad's office and turn left towards the foyer Climb/jump/fly up to the top of the middle tower and fly across to the glowing area  You can ignore the enemies here If you did, there's no need to buy them, but extra bombs could be useful Now you'll need to defeat the Driller Worm Touching them will get them to move, but moving them from the bottom will hurt you Defeat all the Splicers (again, notice that they're jumping into water!) and go towards the Medical Hill’s office, who seems to be getting progressively unstable with every chapter You can't see it because of the camera, but just fly straight across Enter the door at the end of the corridor and read the note that's under the door If you have problems with beating all the guards in Hestia, use the Hypnotize Big Daddy plasmid to get some help This time, move the camera down to the right and look below until you spot a CROWN in an alcove underneath where you are, a little to the left (close to the entrance gate of the cave)   Hit the button in the middle of the next platform, then head up the spring to a speed section with zip lines and the like, which will take you to the very top of the room, where you'll face off several enemies Ignore the entrance in the front, turn right, and then go through the doors on the right side   After receiving the journal entry leave the closet and open the drawer that's near the closet door   While you are on the zip line, there will be a CROWN on one of them, then you'll need to switch to the left zip line so you don't fall off Tensions rise as the remaining group members gather in the basement  9 You can too if you simply follow the on-screen prompts ? Collect Totems and Clues, as they can help you avoid trouble, and in some cases are required in order to save the life of some of your characters After making this tough decision, the prologue concludes Although it was briefly tempting to Kiss Mike, we felt that he ultimately deserved another frosty snowball to the face, and thus chose to Grab Snowball instead They take two hits to defeat Just before the entrance to the second part of the village (the one to the left of where the mayor is), check the ground for footprints near the big tree Then use the energy beam on the blue orb to the right and jump on the springs until you reach a higher ledge above Head right three screens, up one screen, and right a screen, killing or avoiding the various octoroks and tektites on your way Ashley sees something and you must choose to either Follow Chris or Investigate Movement In the first part of the village, spend robot parts at the second repair station to rebuild the well (it's close to a small fountain on the left wall) Cross the crumbling path ahead and defeat the robots at the end To defeat Manhalda, you must destroy each of his four appendages, which can be done either by slashing at them one at a time, or by placing a bomb that hits multiple claws at once Ropes move slowly until they see Link, at which point they will speed up and try to hit him Beckon, Pet, Play, Pet, and Pet are the actions needed to open the Spare option  Get back to the power switch and then flip it - the lights should be back now When you go to leave, Jefferson appears and a very strange conversation will play out Use the same methods to defeat Manhalda as you did in Level 3 In the ruined structure in the northwest part of the island (where you open the gate to access the Crater Lake level), check on the right immediatly as you enter the structure to find footprints on the ground Inside the control room you can examine a poster near the door Climb up, press the button, then cross to the left using the energy beam and open the CHEST There is a breakable wall up here with a crown inside Drop down and pull the handles in the middle to make some robots fall down Jump on the spring here while the panel is down, then jump on the platforms to the right to reach a crown Then enjoy a cutscene with Dr  10 Instead, leave the deer in peace and you will get through without a scratch, triggering a Butterfly Effect  As soon as you arrive on the upper floor, the game will be saved room that's on the far left corner of the corridor Some situations consist of timed choices or QTE’s (quick time events), requiring a quick reaction to the prompts At the leftmost tip of the beach area (left from where you start) behind a big boulder Yup For instance, a black Totem shows a prediction of a potential death scenario, as we saw in the prologue  When you hear that the robot moved away, leave the hideout carefully, and after making sure that the enemy is far enough, run through the stairs located to the left of your current position Now push the middle mine cart down that track and then jump in it to reach the ledge above where a chest awaits The stepladder lets you cross small rivers and waterways Jump to hit the switch here to change the path and you'll get a crown on the next zip line Go straight ahead until you reach a terminal with a survey -
