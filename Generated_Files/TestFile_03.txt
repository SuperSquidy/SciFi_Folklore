Next, you will have to walk through the upper part of the wall to go up to the next screen   Smash through the floor to head down and wait for the boulders to collapse too, revealing a CHEST on the left of the bottom floor Start heading left and you'll find some falling rocks  4 You just wait until it dissipates and attack quickly before it reactivates When the squirrel appears in the range, we chose to shoot the bag instead, which resulted in another Butterfly Effect You'll see Cobb running away As you walk down the path, you’ll quickly be introduced to Mike, Emily’s ex Instead, jump down in the gap on the left to find another CROWN, then use the sping to go up and get the CHEST on the left From here, take the other speed section on the left to reach the area where Cliff is waiting for you with the plane Same area as mentioned above, climb the red walls as Knuckles and at the very top of the wall you'll find a chest  16   Follow the path to the other side of the bridge and jump down in the quarry Head into her parents bedroom on the second floor While they're recoiling, take a run for it Also on the same speed track as mentioned above, but right before you get off it at the end Break the boulder below that gap to reveal a spring leading inside this room  This room has some Keese and Bladetraps in the corner They teleport around the room and fire beams that you can block if you have the Magical Shield Use the ramp to get on the ledge above, where you'll find a CROWN When you go to leave, Jefferson appears and a very strange conversation will play out Inside you will see someone sitting on in a chair, back turned Smash the wall to your right to reveal a path underneath  21 This time you will get some ammo Now you can go on to the next area, but there is some unfinished business before you go Then go left and follow the path down on the right Ultimately, your goal is to look at the floor right in front of his couch One of them lays dead in the workshops, so it's an easy shot, but the other three will require you to actually kill the monsters once more (well, if you're lucky, there's a chance that the bodies of the ones you've already killed haven't disappeared already)  You don't need to kill the enemies in this room, just navigate around them and make it to the staircase   Then drop down and get on the speed section Use the right stick to aim at the indicated targets, and use R2 to shoot Then smash the big rock on the middle cliff to reveal a spring Unlock the gate with the crystal you got and get ready Rejoin the group and keep going Leave the room and get back to the corridor, turn to the left and get inside the "South Stairwell" Do this again until you reach the other side  Awakening The level starts while the character is sitting on the armchair from the previous mission  Your main task is to start up the elevator, which can be located near the data buffer terminal and the map (point 1 on the map above) -

they are able to notice the main character only from an extremely short distance, so it's fairly easy to just avoid them   Head towards the back room and open the light Cross the fallen bridge and in the next part, before going on the speed section, look to the left behind some debris to find a CHEST Repeat this process three times to defeat him and get the Crystal Pull the handle here to blow up the wall ahead Head back to the mainland and head down one and left one To the right of where you start on the beach, there's a rock with a  spring on it Take it and the lights will go out for a moment To the right there's a computer  This room has a new enemy called the Lanmola Hit the left mine cart, then jump onto the spring inside it to reach the ledge above  6   Now you can go into the path to the left 06 - Crouch and go through the opening in the wall into the office of sorts  This is a sidescrolling room, which usually appear in dungeons when you have found a new item Diner The Diner is a fairly busy place, so before going in, let's take care of everything outside Search around the area to your right Until Dawn Chapter 7 opens with Sam crawling through the basement ventilation shaft just fours hours before dawn There are a few objects along the way you can interact with  You can either kill or ignore these Dodongos If not, you will end up at the school  15 Use Tails to fly from the edge of the structure to the archway just ahead where a chest is  Leave the panel, turn around 180 degrees and go straight ahead, until you reach another group of buildings Fortunately for you, the enemy is blind as a mole, especially because it's so dark in here, but you can't do two things while moving around the area - don't use flashlight and don't sprint Move out to the gate ahead and Eggman will show up Don't take it Basically, the idea is: you are the Big Daddy and you have to protect your Little Sister Head towards the exit, and you will see the principal Once you are done with him, enter the room and walk directly forward Then go right and use the spring to climb up in the area above The front door is blocked though, so head around to the side Standing out front of the diner is a trucker Jump on the springs, then follow the path to the some speed boosts and springs at the end Do that twice to kill him Behind the structure is a chest    Back in the hub world, you can now complete a new sidequest Then go stand on the opposite side of the platform and move the camera down to the left It’s up to you Fight off all the enemies here to lower another bridge One involves the statue and fountain, the second involves the skater kids  You will end up in Station Control room  When you arrive at the crossroads, go straight ahead and press the button to open the hatch  There's quite a few Like-Likes in this room To make the best use of our guide, try to look on our maps as often as necessary Just pick up the Map and head down then left It should already be revealed, but if not, burn the 3rd bush from the top on the right After opening the gate leading to the Abandoned Facility level (near the turtle guy), head up and fly up the vent using Tails There's a chest here At the leftmost tip of the beach area, use the spring to climb up the cliff above and you'll find a chest at the end of the ledge Go to the room called "Dive Room", jump from the next ladder, open the doors and go through the next one You can bomb the north wall for a secret room entrance, but it's just an Old Man with some information that isn't very useful right now Then break the grate in the left wall to find a CROWN Talk to him, and he will get up and out of the water Before moving on, there is still one more thing to get in this room using Amy   Now head back all the way up and use the speed boost on the right to go through a very short speed section It isn't as stupid as it sounds Head down the hall and turn right, then go to the end to pick up the keys The next section is the same as the first, although in tighter quarters and with a few more people with flashlights  17 Congratulations, you have completed Life is Strange!         Then you'll arrive at the end where a boss battle against Eggman will take place The easiest way to play the game is merely to 'walk towards the mountain'; the mountain is the only goal, and aside from the glyphs and symbols there really isn't much else to do (unless you wish to run around aimlessly and explore) We chose not to shoot any Wendigos in this section given that killing Wendigos isn’t the best option Indeed, it saves you constantly insofar gauge Planning is full when you receive a normally fatal blow A good way to inflict a lot of damage is as follows: VOID x3 + CRASH (+ sneak attack combo effect) + BREACH (image10) So you run the most powerful sneak attacks Destroy one in the right wall and the other can be destroyed by sending a bot into the tunnel on the right Near the desks on which the computers can be found, slightly to the l left, there's a map of the station - unfortunately, it's only a drawing, as it has no real function in the game As Ashley we decided to be Sympathetic instead of Dismissive Then cross the conveyor belt to the right and hit the button Go through the door with the ‘Morgue’ sign, but don’t go down the left hallway just yet It leads to the garage Let’s try and hold on to the remaining characters, shall we? After the horrific cutscene, quickly have Mike aim the rifle and shoot at the alleged killer When done, exit the sandbox and go to the South Road Frustum When you reach the tunnel leading to the Dive Room, stand up on your feet and start running - the enemy is already aware of your position, so sneaking won't help at all Open it up and collect another chip from inside Some situations consist of timed choices or QTE’s (quick time events), requiring a quick reaction to the prompts Once you’re done freezing your butt off go back inside where you found the cigar From the entrance of the hub world, go right past the crane to an area with a lot of boulders He will sometimes use a colored attack that is prefaced by his eyes  Bomb the right wall for another secret room Part 4 - Up Bracket Towers  Use the main elevator and defeat the Process using zone functions as SPARK There is a trail on the cliff right above the cook's tent Hit the button to move the ceiling, then climb back up and drop down on the left to collect the CROWN If it is, then you simply need to talk to the girl, who will deny you access, then just turn around and go talk to Courtney, who will then let you in If it happens to be flying off, just rewind time until it returns  3 Press the button to move the light, then get in the tube and follow the path to switch over to Amy Asriel is an extremely difficult boss, but the good news is you cannot really fail in this fight! ? There isn't much to do here except avoid Asriel's attacks   Head through the gate to the next area Take the tool, leave the room and run down - in the right corner of the room there's another terminal that can be activated with your tool In our playthrough, we chose the Safe route Look around some more and when you’re ready (you really need to be ready) go ahead and walk through those doors of doom  Watch out for the Bubbles and kill the Wizzrobes in this room   1 What you find is nothing really life threatening, but definitely a bit unpleasant  Max decides that to get them to move, you should ruin Victoria's day After it ends, ignore the nearby terminal for now (but remember its location) and enter the small room on the opposite side 02 - When you are outside, Fontaine will lower your maximum health Then pull the handles at  the top to switch the tubes Then cross  again to reach the area on the other side 17 - There's some ammo around here At the right of the start of the hub world, past the excavation site with the crane, there's a portal leading into the water   Then walk on the conveyor belt and jump over the lasers to reach some tubes Then just jump down the trap and use the zip line to the right to reach another part of the mine  2 There are some more Armos and some Moblins here There’s a trunk on the ground containing several bones Continue down the path until you discover a sign on the base of a figure, which essentially explains the meaning behind the various Totems you can find in the game Take the elevator from the lobby to join First, warn him before he gets in the room so he doesn't get hit in the head Find the X and stomp it to get a SHINY, then smash the fake wall to reveal a secret room with a CHEST inside Jump on it and on the next ones to collect the CROWN Since Wendigos aren’t typically hurt by bullets a chase ensues Just wait a few moments for each barrier Spare you Find the hidden X and slam it to obtain a SHINY Here, just straight ahead from the entrance, you will find a familiar growth, which can be interacted in order to restore any lost health (which will this time be commented by Catherine)  Go back to Langford's lab and use the U-Invent station to create the Lazarus Factoruse them She will want you to kill her, and you have three choices From the warp point, head left one, up one and right one This fight will take you to the fourth user level  Go straight ahead, until you reach a terminal with an intercom, positioned on the wall on the right side of the tunnel Snap its picture to get this photo This time the twist is that she gets killed by Ryan The “ghost” appears again and this time Chris sees it Make your way to the right and use the spring at the end to jump up, then jump to the left on the scaffholding and use the energy beam and springs to climb to the very top of the robot, where a crown awaits Pacifist Boss Tips: Toriel ? Use Spare on every turn to proceed With your new friend leading the way walk outside and make your way to the next building Start playing the messages and listen to them before proceeding to enter the door on the left side Leave through the staircase and bomb the right wall Don't scare it again yet, instead go to the window that's to the left of the fireplace and open it This is for example to ensure that the cells receive a Process shield or they are duplicated for gains of 2 or 4% additional experience When you reach the leftmost beam, instead of going right, go left to find a CHEST, then triple jump up the ledge to the left and turn the camera around to locate a CROWN above the left beam Take a turn to the left, enter the small corridor, and continue straight ahead Once out of her room, your goal is the garage, however there are a few other things you can do first To open the gate, you must grab the round switch and: ?
