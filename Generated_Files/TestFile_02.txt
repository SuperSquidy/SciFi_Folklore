A cutscene occurs with some important QTE decisions Their biggest flaw is a severely limited vision - they are able to notice the main character only from an extremely short distance, so it's fairly easy to just avoid them Afterwards, turn around - directly in front of you should be a growth (WAU) and a terminal with a Data Buffer Head back up to the area with the four buttons and press them to open the door While above, fetches pass at 2 You can choose to warn Victoria or keep the info to yourself This particular one is called a Death Totem, which generally indicates how a member of your group will die There's nothing to look around for here, because all the passages are locked, so approach the doors on the left side of the elevator, open them and get inside Upon taking the rifle out of the case, we opted to Show Jessica the rifle rather than Scare her with it Here, a new entrant has elected domicile, a kind of dog named Luna by the sword Transistor So, make sure occasionally to clean using the SPARK control for example AUDIO DIARY: [Meeting Atlas] - Diane McClintock 07 - Get to the 4F and enter Atlas' headquarters Interrogation] - Sullivan 06 - In this corridor you will see another Audio Diary Soon after, you are confronted with yet another option: either Follow Footprints or Follow Noise To the left of the first small quarry where you pressed the three buttons to cross, go through the gate here (which leads to the area where the sailor is) and look to the right of the elevator for a trail on the ground After a nice chat over a meal you are free to explore the area on your own You must snatch it by force, by pressing and holding the interaction button and then pulling it away from its grasp On the wall, right next to the entrance to the room with the "Break Room" sign there's a terminal, which allows you to perform a Data Buffer Dormitories - Morning Now that you are outside, there are three things you can do Yes, it’s as crazy as it sounds The police officer will talk about the Prescott family In our playthrough Emily runs and the stranger begins to chase her Speaking of which, looking at the Mine Danger Map suggested that further exploration may have led to other explorable areas, but also may have proven fatal  The Compass is lying in the middle of the floor There's also a trail on the ground here Before moving forward, head backwards south towards the screen to find a CHEST  15 You'll then be taken to Cliff who will ask you to go set the crystal in the lock of the first big gate you came across Then switch to Sonic and enter his secret room on the right Without additional information, you may be confused but just actually press any key to start the game Pacifist Boss Tips: Mad Dummy ? At the end of this section you will run into the Mad Dummy  Kill these Wizzrobes and grab the Compass That said, they do not constitute a specific threat Once you have all 6, exit the area and you will see the bottles lined up on a shelf on the right, and a photo prompt will be there  This room has a large amount of Keese, none of which need to be killed  This room is another confusing one   In the next area pull the handles in the right wall and some enemies will show up  Ruins ?

After getting the picture, you can leave her room If you kill all the Zols, you can earn an extra five rupees You only have about 15 seconds to do all this, so if you take to long, or mess up, rewind time to the beginning and try again until you get it right This will open the door to the left, but it is not required to go there Right next to the tool there's also a note, which explains how the Omnitool works - activate it and then put it down If you fail to guess it, you can also enter the back-up code found on the plastic U Once at the bottom of the stairs, we took the path to the right You'll also want at least 68 rupees for the Red Medicine, as you'll very likely need it So head back all the way to the entrance of the hub world and open the first gate Rewind time and bring it up to him to learn more Then jump on the pillars and grab the second plant on the farthest pillar Break all the crates and stuff here to reveal a warp pad in the corner Your teacher will be talking, and while he is you are able to look around at various objects on your desk Now you'll need to jump into the chasm to die and start over at the beginning of the split if you want to get the other collectible There are no "real" enemies in this room, but the Blade Traps do pose a problem  Get inside the blue train now, check the notepad lying on one of the seats, and then head towards the driver seat These Octoroks are identical to the red ones, but they are a bit tougher to kill This next dungeon will require you to use many bombs  None of these enemies need to be killed, and there's no reward for doing so, so head down    - Leave the cave and head to the left one screen, down one screen, and left two on the lower side We chose not to shoot any Wendigos in this section given that killing Wendigos isn’t the best option During these tests, you must accomplish the goal with specific functions and not using the skills acquired previously Keep an eye out on the ground to discover another clue, in the form of a Light from Below, glowing from one of the floor vents Then use the zip line and run through the rest of the path  If you've been following the guide, this will be your second Old Man encounter in a dungeon Then use the energy beam on the blue orb to the right and jump on the springs until you reach a higher ledge above Opening the chest triggers a cutscene, so if you plan on looking around the room, be sure to do so before opening the chest Open the folder and examine the map 14 - To get inside Chompers, you have to use Telekinesis to grab the key that you can see through the window An audio diary to be found here, as well as some other minor gadgets (including chlorophyll that will be necessary in a while) Hit the two next ones, climb, press the next one, climb, press next two, then climb again, press the button at the top on the right, climb the ceiling, hit the left button and the next one, climb some more, hit button, climb, and finally, double jump to the left for a CROWN before leaving on the right Now switch to Amy and take the left path, crossing the beams We weren’t though Collect the items from each of the drawers, including a Death Certificate, a Name Tag, and a Chapel Security Pass, which you will need to open the other door in the room The battles will mirror the ones earlier in the game, just use actions for each fight and eventually you will free everyone Grab the Dungeon Map on the ground Enter the building, and you will see your path blocked by fire  Leave the toilet (and ignore the next one) and go to the passage in front of you If you don't, he will find them using a location tool Near the end we chose to Disarm instead of Hit After a few seconds the Omnitool will be enhanced and you will have to get it out of the terminal Fontaine attacks you by long-range energy missiles and by melee thrusts (he kinda sums up the Bouncers with the Rosies) Head to the first floor of the lodge, and to the right of the double doors where you can find a Prom Night Photo After a short scene use your newly acquired power to open the door (hit the controls to the left)   Easy, right? Pick up the Heart Container and head up There's no other way  3 You must successfully shoot each Wendigo to ensure Chris survives There is not a Spare option for this boss, just use his minions to damage him enough to end the fight In the end, however, you will have to go to the right and head up the stairs to the left Kill all of the Zols in this room for a key Remember: Big Daddies are always neutral towards you, unless you attack them first He will mutate into a god-like killing machine, triggering the final battle of the Neutral play-through  SNOWDIN1 / 7  You gotta love sans and Papyrus, right?
