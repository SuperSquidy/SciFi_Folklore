Sinclair's Spirits As the scene shifts, we’re introduced to yet another member of the group, Ashley Right now it's practically impossible to do so, as the modules switch way too quick (It's very important you take the speed boost from the upper part of the side- scrolling section if you want to get this crown) Once you're on top of the raised area, you can pick up the cube and take it down to the button It’s bright, but it will make finding a nearby Guidance Totem easier Slam it to make some springs appear Speak to her, and she won't pay you much attention cause she thinks you don't even know her  Chamber 03  This chamber contains no doors, buttons or cubes, but is simply to test that you grasp the basics of how to use portals Move it until you see a CHEST on a ledge below, to the left Beware of the spoilers, though  Run up and grab the Triforce Open the folder and you'll find the cabinet combination as well as a letter It is this time a personal message Asher Kendrell sent directly to Red  In the elevator in question, sword Transistor suddenly feels very badly but you can not do anything  In the same spot as mentioned above, but head over to the piece of land on the other side of the water and jump on the cliff to the left to find a crown  There's plenty of enemies in this room The only difference between the two enemies is that you must attack the head of a Lanmola to defeat it Now move around and check the 6 photographs hanging on the map Jump on it then use the energy beam to cross over to a chest  You can kill all the Keese for some more Bombs, or you can just ignore them In the room ahead you'll need to destroy a robot, then hit the button in the center and defeat the other enemies Knock one koopa out of the way so you don't get run over, and then bounce on the left side of another one while jumping from a standing position (i This may sound straightforward, but the cube is on top of an unclimbable raised platform You'll grab a CROWN up in the air as you land onto the next platform The battle consists of three separate phases However, feel free to choose any option Chris is skeptical and as a response you can either Insist you saw a ghost of Concede that you are unsure of your own observations You'll come to two piranha plants with a beetle between them When you are in the upper chamber along with the Waver, freeze it when it is halfway between you and the blue door, and use it as a platform to reach the door They take more hits to kill, and often hold items At this point, you may choose to continue to drop down to the bottom of the far right vertical shaft and make your way to Hideout II, and visit points 6 and 7 on your way back to Brinstar Press it to deactivate another barrier Go right again and hit the button to move the wall Be sure to snag the Guidance Totem at the bottom of the stairs Fall down to the bottom and you'll find a door that will lead to many more secrets When ready, give her the book  22 One of them lays dead in the workshops, so it's an easy shot, but the other three will require you to actually kill the monsters once more (well, if you're lucky, there's a chance that the bodies of the ones you've already killed haven't disappeared already) Then keep on climbing the ceiling to reach the next handle The fastest route up is firing a portal at the location in the screenshot, but if you can't get a clear shot, you will have to work your way up slowly Bomb any blocks that get in your way as you travel to the left  Go down the pipe immediately right of this to reach an underwater area Go up and break the wall on the left to find a secret room with a CROWN Before you travel back up to the ledge, notice that there is an area behind the ground-level extended panel  13 This time it’s a Tennis Photo from not too long ago Removing the cubes, notice that there is actually an additional area that you can crouch and crawl into Here you have travel to the end of the tunnel, so that you can enter a small room on the left side Use Sonic or Tails to run across the water and head over to the structure in the middle of the lake The path will split into three Or just hit him with fireballs like a cheapskate  You will end up near a growth on a wall, which should be used to heal the character This marks the end, as a long cutscene will play out and Max realizes her powers have caused a future she couldn't possibly of planned for and South Pier It will probably do far less damage to you than Ridley would Jump on his back and try to land on or avoid the goomba The energy pellet will go into the receiver, and the platform will start moving Close it and examine the torn piece of paper that was hidden beneath it 03 -
